        This endpoint acts as a notification queue. To ensure resilience against communication failures, reading entries from this queue does not consume them. After successfully receiving a notification from this endpoint, the EMS should call the "DELETE /postalVotes/{id}" endpoint for each notification that it has received.

        The server will not lock or hide records between the GET and DELETE calls, so it is not safe to call this endpoint concurrently from multiple client workers or threads without adding client-side deduplication or idempotency.
